# 3CNF-Solver

First Assignment for the course CS F407, Artificial Intelligence held during the first semester of the academic year 2021-22.

The repository contains initial ideas, the code snippets, observations in the form of graphs and the final report submitted for grading for the 3CNF-Solver Assignment

Steps to run:

To change the csv file: Change the line number 37 in CNF_Creator.py to contain the name of csv file you want.

To generate a random sentence, change the line number 165 to 'sentence = cnfC.CreateRandomSentence(m=sentence_len)' where sentence_len will be the length of your sentence.

Code to generate graphs is commented out in the main function. It takes a long time to run the code for 20 runs per sentence length so I have included the readings in the AI_Assignment1_Graphs.ipynb file.

In case you have any doubts or any bugs to report, or want to use a piece of this code, feel free to contact me.
